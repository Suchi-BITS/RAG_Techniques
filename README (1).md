# All RAG Techniques: A Simpler, Hands-On Approach 


This repository takes a clear, hands-on approach to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, breaking down advanced techniques into straightforward, understandable implementations. Instead of relying on frameworks like `LangChain` or `FAISS`, everything here is built using familiar Python libraries `openai`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and a few others.

The goal is simple: provide code that is readable, modifiable, and educational. By focusing on the fundamentals, this project helps demystify RAG and makes it easier to understand how it really works.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a specific RAG technique.  Each notebook provides:

*   A concise explanation of the technique.
*   A step-by-step implementation from scratch.
*   Clear code examples with inline comments.
*   Evaluations and comparisons to demonstrate the technique's effectiveness.
*   Visualization to visualize the results.

Here's a glimpse of the techniques covered:

## Core Concepts

*   **Embeddings:**  Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.  We use Nebius AI's embedding API and, in many notebooks, also the `BAAI/bge-en-icl` embedding model.

*   **Vector Store:**  A simple database to store and search embeddings.  We create our own `SimpleVectorStore` class using NumPy for efficient similarity calculations.

*   **Cosine Similarity:**  A measure of similarity between two vectors.  Higher values indicate greater similarity.

*   **Chunking:**  Dividing text into smaller, manageable pieces.  We explore various chunking strategies.

*   **Retrieval:** The process of finding the most relevant text chunks for a given query.

*   **Generation:**  Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a response based on the retrieved context and the user's query.  We use the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` model via Nebius AI's API.

*   **Evaluation:**  Assessing the quality of the RAG system's responses, often by comparing them to a reference answer or using an LLM to score relevance.
